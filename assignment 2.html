    <h1> <b>Things That Make Se Sneeze:</b> </h1>
    <p>
        I wanted to put together a quick list of stuff that make me Sneeze
    </p>
    <p>
        It's because I keep forgetting to keep avoid this stuff, and may be if I write it down I'll remember <br /> it.
        Particular about the sawdust
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dust </li>
        <li> Ground Black Pepper</li>
        <li> Doing the following:</li>
        <ol>
            <li> Cutting some wood using a saw</li>
            <li> Forgetting to clean the dust off </li>
            <li> Looking at the cut real close in order to make sure that it's right</li>
            <li> Breathing in</li>
            <ul>
                <li> It's worse when I breathe in slowly and get a real-lungs full of fresh sawdust</li>
                <li> The sawdust smells nice, though </li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <li> The next funny item</li>
        <li> The Final, Deep Insightful Item</li>
    </ul>
