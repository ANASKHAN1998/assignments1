<h1> <strong> I like to go to swimming in the summer . </strong> </h1>
<p>
    Swimming is my most favourite activity in the summer . When the sun is shinning <br /> and the air is warm , you
    will find
    me dipping into my backyard pool. It's not an <br /> impressive pool, only three feet deep , but it's mine.
</p>
<p> There are 3 reasons I like to swim:</p>
<ul>
    <li> I gets lots of exercise </li>
    <li> I enjoy the freedom</li>
    <li> I have an opportunity to be in the sun </li>
</ul>
